# Welcome to Intro to AI Skills with Python by Capital One, Part III

In this workshop, you're going to learn how to Markovify your app! 

## What tools does this app use?

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - Python3.5 comes standard inside Glitch. You don't have to install anything! 
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/) - The python package manager. This allows you to install any of the libraries and frameworks that your project will need. This also comes already installed in Glitch! 
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - A simple and flexible Python Web Framework that provides tools, libraries and technologies to build a web application. Glitch will install this for us! 
- [Flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io) - Flask-SocketIO is a tool that makes creating the chat part (sending messages back and forth) faster. 
- [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) - Twitter for Python! This is a library that makes it easier to use the Twitter API with Python
- [Markovify](http://www.tweepy.org/) - Markovify library!

Your Project

### ← static/logo.svg

That's the MLH logo you see on the demo. 

### ← static/script.js

This is the file that makes our website interactive. This is a JavaScript file.

### ← static/style.css

This is the file that styles our website so that it doesn't look just like plain text. 

### ← templates/homepage.html

That's the index file of our webpage. When a user navigates to our webpage, it will automatically open homepage.html. 

### ← .env.example

This is the file where you'll store credentials from Twitter. We'll learn more about this later. 

### ← LICENSE

This file states that you can edit, change, or use this app however you want! 

### ← config.py

This file specifies some settings for our app. 

### ← Glitch.json

This file makes sure that our app runs using the correct version of Python 

### ← main.py

This file handles the request and response cycle of our app. 

### ← markov_bot.py

This file retrieves Tweets from Twitter and uses some of the scraping techniques you learned in the previous workshop to return clean Tweets. 

### ← README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ← requirements.txt

This is a file that tells Glitch what Python libraries we need to install.
